How to make your own client:

1. Just copy this repo/download it as a ZIP under the green code button.
2. Make a github respitory and add all the files that you downloaded.
3. You are almost there.
4. Once all the files are uploaded, go to settings.
5. Now navigate to pages, click it, and make sure the respitory it public so it works.
6. Make sure that the branch in the pages section is set to "Main", "/ (root)" and then click save.
7. Give it a few minutes and then your client is ready.
8. Finaly click on launch site and your good to go!

Now go impress your friends at school because we know you all are kids who have nothing to do besides play eaglercraft. YAY!!!

Special thanks to the Eagler Devs, This would not have been possible without your starter client!
